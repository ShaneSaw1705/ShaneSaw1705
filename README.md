Kia Ora! ðŸ‘‹
I'm a passionate self-taught programmer with over 9 years of experience in the coding world. Recently, I completed the Dev Academy Full-stack Developer Bootcamp in July 2024, where I dedicated 800 hours to mastering RestAPIs, databases, authentication, and front-end development.

My journey in programming has been driven by a love for learning and an eagerness to explore new technologies. Dev Academy has further honed my ability to quickly adapt to new tools and frameworks, enhancing my versatility as a developer.

I thrive in collaborative team environments and enjoy interacting with people, sharing ideas, and working together to solve complex problems. Whether it's brainstorming solutions or tackling coding challenges, I'm always excited to contribute and learn from others.

The last few years I have been doing temp work and dedicating large amounts my free time to a children's charity - R.I.S.K where we host regular events and help families in need

Let's build something amazing together! ðŸš€
